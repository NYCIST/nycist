# Welcome to the NYCIST Github!

This repo will serve as a helpful starting place for those who want to contribute to the NYCIST Github, or simply want to host their code in a private repo.

If you haven't used Github before that's OK!  This will hopefully help you get started on how to use and contribute to this organization.
