## Repo Request Info:

**Purpose of repo**
A short description of how you plan to use the repo (host your school or department's code, curriculum purposes, etc.)

**Public or private**
Should your repo be visible to all of Github or not?

**License**
Github offers different licensing options for your repo. NYCIST recommends the MIT license, as it's simple and permissive.
