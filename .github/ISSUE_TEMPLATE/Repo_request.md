## Repo Request Info:

**Purpose of repo**
A short description of how you plan to use the repo (host your school or department's code, curriculum purposes, etc.)

**School / EDU Institution**
The name of your school. This is so we can create a team for you and anyone else who may need access from your school, so you all can contribute to your own repo(s)

**Public or private**
Should your repo be visible to all of Github or not?

**License**
Github offers different licensing options for your repo. NYCIST recommends the MIT license, as it's simple and permissive.

Look at https://choosealicense.com/ for help with choosing a license.
