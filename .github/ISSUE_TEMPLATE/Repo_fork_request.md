name: Repo Fork Request
about: Request to fork a repo you've created into the NYCIST org

## Repo Request Info:

**Link to existing repo**
This is what NYCIST will fork.

**Purpose of repo**
A short description of how you plan to use the repo (host your school or department's code, curriculum purposes, etc.). If your existing repo already has a README with this information, you can just link it here.

**Public or private**
Should your forked repo be visible to all of Github or not?

**License**


If your repo does not have a license already associated with it, Github offers different licensing options for your repo. NYCIST recommends the MIT license, as it's simple and permissive.

Look at https://choosealicense.com/ for help with choosing a license.
